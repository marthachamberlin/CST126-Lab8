Reading and Writing Binary Files 1
Create a text file that has the following information:
* First name
* Last name
* Hourly wage
* Hours worked
Write a program that reads in the text file storing this information in an array of structures and then write the information to a binary file.
Before any data from the text file is written to the binary file, write the number of records in your array.
Be sure to use strings (NOT dynamic strings) for the name data members.

Write another program that reads the information stored in the binary file created above.

Write the contents of the array to the screen.
